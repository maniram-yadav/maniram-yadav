***"If you are looking for a developer who only understands one way of thinking about code, I am not the right one for you. But if you're looking for someone who can bring perspectives from Java's structure, Go's simplicity, Rust's safety, Python data analysis and JavaScript's flexibility, then you will never regret the solutions I'll build for you."***
